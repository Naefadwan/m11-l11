# Module 11 — Applied Lab: Service Monitoring

Add a full observability layer to the M10 backend — three Prometheus metric
families (counter, histogram, gauge), three middleware layers (request-id,
structured logging, metrics), and a `/metrics` endpoint mounted via
`prometheus_client.make_asgi_app()`. Verify end-to-end with a 3-question RAG
smoke evaluator.

The published Applied Lab guide is the canonical task list. See
TalentLMS → Module 11 → Applied Lab for the link, or check your cohort's
Slack pinned message.

## Setup

Use **Python 3.11** for this template (the pinned `pydantic==2.6.0` does not build on Python 3.13).

```bash
git checkout -b lab-11-service-monitoring
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
cp .env.example .env
```

The `spacy download` step is needed only if you plan to run `uvicorn` directly on your host (for example, to debug). The Docker image installs the model from a pinned wheel, so `docker compose up -d` does not need this step. Without the model, `/extract` silently returns a stub.

The `lab-11-service-monitoring` branch is what the autograder workflow runs against and what you push your PR from.

Edit `.env` to set your Neo4j password and Weaviate URL (the values from
your Module 10 deliverable).

## Bring up the M10 stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/readyz
```

A 200 means `api` is up and connected to Neo4j + Weaviate; if you see
anything else, give the stack 60 seconds for cold starts and try again
before debugging.

Seed the stores (idempotent):

```bash
bash seed_neo4j.sh
bash seed_weaviate.sh
```

## Run the autograder locally

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

On the unmodified starter, the autograder will FAIL (by design — your TODOs
are unimplemented). Implement `api/observability.py`, wire the three
middlewares + mount `/metrics` in `api/main.py`, and implement
`eval_rag_smoke.py`; then re-run.

## Tear down

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Submission

Open a PR within your fork. The PR description must include:

1. Confirmation that `docker compose up -d` brings up the stack and `/readyz` returns 200.
2. Confirmation that `python eval_rag_smoke.py` exits 0.
3. A short paragraph (~100 words) describing one design decision you made.
4. Paste your PR URL into TalentLMS → Module 11 → Lab 11 to submit this assignment.
